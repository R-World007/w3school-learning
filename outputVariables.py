# print() is often used to output variables

x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

# we can output multiple variables with only one print()
a = '1'
b = '2'
c = '3'
print(a, b, c)
print(a + b + c) # we can also use + opreator but when we have int or float values, it will add
d = 5
g = 5
print(d + g)

# if we try to output different data type is will be error when we use "+"
h = 5
i = "5"
#print(h + i) # error code
print(h, i) # but we can output this type with ","
# comma is  the best way to output multiple variables
